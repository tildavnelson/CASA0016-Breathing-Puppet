# CASA0016-Breathing-Puppet
Project for the CASA0016: Making, Designing &amp; Building Connected Sensor Systems. making a wearable sensor for a puppeteer to animate their puppets using a rubber stretch sensor.

1. Breathing Monitor

I needed a way to sense a puppeteer’s breathing in real time so the puppet could “breathe” naturally along with them. Because the puppeteer would be speaking, I wanted to avoid mask-based sensors such as CO₂ or airflow detectors, which are affected by speech and are uncomfortable to wear. Instead, I focused on directly measuring chest expansion. To do this, I used a rubber stretch sensor worn around the puppeteer’s torso; as the chest expands during inhalation and relaxes during exhalation, the sensor stretches and changes resistance.
